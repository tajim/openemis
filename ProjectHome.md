OpenEMIS is a generic open source Education Management Information System (EMIS) developed by UNESCO.

In order to contribute to educational policy formulation and planning, based on data and evidence, UNESCO Division for Planning and Development of Education Systems (ED/PDE/PER) engaged in the design of generic Education Management Information System (EMIS) software called OpenEMIS. The software was meant to constitute a basic, customizable and affordable EMIS tool for countries with weak statistical database to be able to adapt it to the needs of specific national contexts. The first such tool was tried out and disseminated some two years ago, but soon bugs and needs for improvement appeared. In response to the repeated requests of data managers and planning experts in education ministries for an improved version of OpenEMIS, efforts to fix the problems and to further improve the software have been made. In January 2011, an improved, functional version of OpenEMIS has been released.
